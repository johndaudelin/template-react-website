# Highlander Challenge Portal

A web portal for the NJIT Highlander Challenge campaign built in React.

## Setup and Running

Clone the repository and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

    $ cd highlander-challenge
    $ npm install

After this finishes running, run the following command:

    $ npm start

You should soon see a browser window open to `http://localhost:8080` and see the website displayed!

## Deploying

To deploy the website, run the following command:

    $ npm run build

You now have a fully independent `dist/` folder with the website code bundled. Open `dist/index.html` to see the website.
